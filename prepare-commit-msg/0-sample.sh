# The prepare-commit-msg hook is called after the pre-commit hook to populate
# the text editor with a commit message. This is a good place to alter
# the automatically generated commit messages for squashed or merged commits.

# An example hook script to prepare the commit log message.
# Called by "git commit" with the name of the file that has the
# commit message, followed by the description of the commit
# message's source.  The hook's purpose is to edit the commit
# message file.  If the hook fails with a non-zero status,
# the commit is aborted.

# This hook includes three examples. The first one removes the
# "# Please enter the commit message..." help message.
#
# The second includes the output of "git diff --name-status -r"
# into the message, just before the "git status" output.  It is
# commented because it doesn't cope with --amend or with squashed
# commits.
#
# The third example adds a Signed-off-by line to the message, that can
# still be edited.  This is rarely a good idea.

COMMIT_MSG_FILE=$1 # The name of a temporary file that contains the message. You change the commit message by altering this file in-place.
COMMIT_SOURCE=$2 # The type of commit. This can be message (-m or -F option), template (-t option), merge (if the commit is a merge commit), or squash (if the commit is squashing other commits).
SHA1=$3 # The SHA1 hash of the relevant commit. Only given if -c, -C, or --amend option was given.
